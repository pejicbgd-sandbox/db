## About

Iporm is a basic [ORM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_relational_mapping) package written in PHP. Usage is very simple, it is based on method chaining pattern, so it feels natural and fluent. This is a extension of a simple wrapper that I wrote a long time ago, which expanded and matured with every project.

There are plenty of excellent wrappers out there, but I hope I will save you some precious time with this one.

## Installation

Simplest way to install it is via composer, just pop up you console, and hit 

	composer install iporm/iprom
